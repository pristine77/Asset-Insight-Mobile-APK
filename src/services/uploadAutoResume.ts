/**
 * Automatic resume of an interrupted upload (2026-10-02).
 *
 * Every interrupted upload used to wait for the person to tap Resume upload,
 * even when the app itself had stopped it because the signal dropped or a
 * transfer stalled. On weak coverage that meant watching the phone and tapping
 * again after each drop. Now an open report continues by itself once the
 * connection is back.
 *
 * The rules:
 *   - Only an upload the app stopped by itself resumes on its own: a lost
 *     connection, a stalled transfer, a transient network or server error, or
 *     a Submit that found no connection. A Pause the person tapped, an account
 *     change and anything that needs a decision are left as they are.
 *   - Only while the report stays open. A closed form, a restarted app or a
 *     draft reopened from Drafts keep the explicit Resume upload button.
 *   - The connection must hold for AUTO_RESUME_STABLE_SIGNAL_MS and our own
 *     server must answer first, so a flickering signal does not start and stop
 *     the upload over and over.
 *   - After AUTO_RESUME_MAX_TRIES_WITHOUT_PROGRESS automatic tries in a row that
 *     store no new file, it stops and leaves the Resume upload button.
 *
 * Resuming is the same action as tapping Resume upload: the same submission and
 * upload session, files already stored are skipped, and the server refuses a
 * second report for the same submission. The form side of this lives in
 * components/forms/useUploadAutoResume.ts.
